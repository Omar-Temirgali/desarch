            An architectural style is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure 
            notable and historically identifiable. A style may include such elements as form, method of 
            construction, building materials, and regional character. Most architecture can be classified 
            as a chronology of styles which change over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, 
            or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.
            Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society and are documented in the subject of 
            architectural history. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes 
            it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. Styles often spread 
            to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other 
            countries follow with their own twist. A style may also spread through colonialism, either by 
            foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. After 
            a style has gone out of fashion, there are often revivals and re-interpretations. For instance, 
            classicism has been revived many times and found new life as neoclassicism. Each time it is 
            revived, it is different.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Vernacular architecture works slightly differently and is listed separately. It is the 
            native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods 
            and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from 
            region to region even within a country, and takes little account of national styles or technology. 
            As western society has developed, vernacular styles have mostly become outmoded by new technology 
            and national building standards.

            Architectural Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues 
            to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. For instance, 
            Renaissance ideas emerged in Italy around 1425 and spread to all of Europe over the next 
            200 years, with the French, German, English, and Spanish Renaissances showing recognisably 
            the same style, but with unique characteristics. An architectural style may also spread 
            through colonialism, either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers 
            moving to a new land. One example is the Spanish missions in California, brought by Spanish 
            priests in the late 18th century and built in a unique style.

        <p class="paragraph">
            After an architectural style has gone out of fashion, revivals and re-interpretations 
            may occur. For instance, classicism has been revived many times and found new life as 
            neoclassicism. Each time it is revived, it is different. The Spanish mission style was 
            revived 100 years later as the Mission Revival, and that soon evolved into the Spanish 
            Colonial Revival.

            Vernacular architecture is listed separately. As vernacular architecture is better understood 
            as suggestive of culture, writ broadly (as well as a theory and a process rather than a 
            thing-in-itself), it technically can encompass every architectural style--or none at all. 
            In and of itself, vernacular architecture is not a style.
